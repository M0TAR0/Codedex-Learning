=== REFLECTION ABOUT PERSONAL GITHUB COPILOT USECASE ===

# Where do you see yourself using it the most?
        The thing that makes my eyes shine about copilot is the advantages it can give me to complete my own personal projects
        and overall that my learning speed can increase a lot. I don't plan to realy on Copilot because it has it's limits and i think
        it's more important to have the right knowledge to solve problems, however that's the other thing, i can rely more on copilot
        to focus on my problem solving skills and spend less time writing code.

        I think that in the end there has to be a balance:
        - Use Copilot when you know what you are doing and just want to speed things up
        - Do it yourself when you are learning, and to better up your skills.

# How is it different from using Stack Overflow or Google?
        It gives you answers faster, at the same instant you ask or even before you can have a question. It's responses also adapts on your specific context
        something that when searching online doesn't happen, you have to adapt whatever you found into your project.

        While it's easier to get the information and solve your problems, it also has its consequences, getting the answer so quickly and easy
        doesn't let the brain actually fully struggle to understand the problem and that makes that the knowledge you could gain by searching
        it up online isn't as valuble to the brain if you get by an AI and thus you forget it faster.

# How does it compare to what you expected?
        Im actually surprised, while i knew that AI can do amazing things, and i had already some previus knowledge of what vibe coding was
        im surprised of the speed at which Copilot can make suggestions, many times i haven't even finished writing and it's giving me a 
        suggestion that i could have not even though about, and instantly, that amazes me.
