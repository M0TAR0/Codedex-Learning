// Step 1: Bring a pot of water to a boil. 
// Note: Use less water than usual to concentrate the starch.
console.log("Boiling heavily salted water.");

// Step 2: Render the Guanciale in a cold pan over medium heat.
console.log("Rendering guanciale until crispy and golden.");

/* Step 3: The Emulsion Base.
   Whisk the eggs and Pecorino Romano together in a bowl until it 
   forms a thick, pale paste. Add the cracked pepper here.

// Step 4: Timing is everything.
console.log("Boiling pasta until 2 minutes before al dente.");

// Step 5: The Marriage.
console.log("Tossing pasta into the guanciale fat with a splash of pasta water.");

/* Step 6: The Tempering.
   Remove from heat entirely before adding the egg mixture. 
   The residual heat creates the sauce; direct heat creates scrambled eggs.

console.log("Folding in the egg mixture away from heat to create a glossy emulsion.");

// THE SECRET INGREDIENT:
// 1/2 tsp of White Truffle Oil or finely minced preserved Black Summer Truffles.
/* While purists scream, the truffle notes bridge the gap between 
   the funky Pecorino and the fatty pork, elevating the dish 
   from 'street food' to 'fine dining' instantly.
